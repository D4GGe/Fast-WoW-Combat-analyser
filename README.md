## Why?

Since the **WoW Midnight** release, the popular **Details! Damage Meter** addon has struggled to provide reliable post-combat analytics. Encounter breakdowns, damage/healing meters, and timeline data are often inaccurate or missing entirely — leaving raiders and M+ pushers without the tools they need to improve.

Existing alternatives like Warcraftlogs require **uploading** your combat logs to an external server and waiting for them to be processed. That's fine for progression review, but when you just want to quickly check how a pull went between attempts, that workflow is too slow.

**Fast WoW Combat Analyser** fills that gap. It reads your `WoWCombatLog` files **directly from disk** and presents a full analysis **instantly** in your browser — no uploads, no accounts, no waiting.

- 🗝️ **Mythic+ support** — key level, timer, timed/depleted status, segment-by-segment breakdown (trash vs bosses)
- 📊 **Detailed meters** — DPS, HPS, damage taken, deaths, and more per encounter
- 💀 **Death log** — see exactly what killed each player
- 🔄 **Live refresh** — re-read the log file mid-session to see the latest data
- 🎨 **Dark theme** — easy on the eyes during late-night prog
